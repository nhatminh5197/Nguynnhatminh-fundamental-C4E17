Q1 : A Boolean value is either true or false. It is named after the British mathematician, George
Boole, who first formulated Boolean algebra — some rules for reasoning about and combining
these values. This is the basis of all modern computer logic
ex :
>>>6 == (3+3)
true
>>>6 == (5+4)
false
>>>n == "bon"
>>> n + "jours" = "bonjour"
true
